# AI-Projects

Collection of AI projects implemented for the Artificial Intelligence course
The implementation is a refactorization of the given starting code consisting of the pictures and the map in pygame. The refactorization consists of layered architecture and scalable map. For each project I implemented the algorithms that move the drone across the map. Also the settings of the algorithms can be set from the settings file.
