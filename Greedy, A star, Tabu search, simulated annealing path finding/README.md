The drone finds the path between 2 points on the map. The position of the drone can be set with right-click and the destination position can be set with left click. Greedy and A* can be shown by pressing G, Tabu by pressing T ( tabu search doesn't always find a path) and simulated annealing by pressing S (C can be pressed to find another path for simulated annealing). <br>

For simulated annealing the keep probability can be set (the probability that a bad solution is kept) and the early stop can be set (the number of iteration 

Color coding: 
Red - Greedy <br>
Yellow - A* <br>
Green - Common for Greedy and A* <br>
Purple - Tabu search <br>
Blue - Simulated annealing <br>
